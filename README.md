# stock-analysis
Microsoft Excel VBA

## Overview

This vba code is refactored code from our original "green_stocks" workbook we created in our learning module. We are refactoring the code in order to increase the efficiency in which it runs in case we wanted to analyze a more complicated and detailed set of data. The code we are refactoring was originally written to determine the Total Daily Volume and annual return for a ticker based on a users input for the year.

## Results

### Analysis based on Stock Analysis for specific year

We found that in 2017, the 12 tickers had a much better return than in 2018. While in 2018 only 2 tickers were positive (ENPH 82%, RUN 85%), in 2017 11 of the 12 tickers ran positive including 4 which had over 100% returns.

### Analysis of Refactored Code Efficiency

We ran into a few errors with type mismatches when we attempted to refactor our code. Need to be able to create a working code before analysis of newly refactored code can be completed

## Summary

Some advantages of refactoring code is that you are working with code that has already been proven to run and work smoothly. By editing previous code you can attempt to reduce redundencies in the code and increase its overall efficiency. Another advantage is that you can tinker with previous code to create brand new analysis without needing to create a whole new script to run. One disadvantage of refactoring code is that if the data set has changed in any way your previous code may be completely useless. It is important when refactoring code to reference the new data set to ensure the code is doing what we want it to do.
